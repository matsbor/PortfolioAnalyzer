# ALPHA MINER PRO - SIMPLE STARTUP GUIDE
# How to check you have everything and start the app

## STEP 1: CHECK YOU HAVE ALL FILES

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
ls -la *.py | grep -E "(institutional|alpha_miner)"
```

### You Should See:

```
alpha_miner_enhanced.py                    (original base file)
institutional_enhancements.py              (v1 features)
institutional_enhancements_v2.py           (v2 features - metal cycle)
integrate_institutional_v2.py              (integration script)
```

**AND MAYBE:**
```
alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py            (integrated version - if you already ran integration)
```

---

## STEP 2: SIMPLE METHOD (Use the startup script)

```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
bash startup_check.sh
```

This will:
- ✅ Check all files are present
- ✅ Run integration if needed
- ✅ Ask if you want to start the app
- ✅ Start it for you

---

## STEP 3: MANUAL METHOD (If you prefer)

### If you DON'T have `alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py`:

```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer

# Run integration
python3 integrate_institutional_v2.py

# Then start
streamlit run alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py
```

### If you ALREADY have `alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py`:

```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
streamlit run alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py
```

---

## STEP 4: IF FILES ARE MISSING

You need to download from Claude (scroll up to find them):

### **Files to Download:**
1. `institutional_enhancements.py`
2. `institutional_enhancements_v2.py`  
3. `integrate_institutional_v2.py`
4. `startup_check.sh` (optional, but helpful)

### **Where to Save Them:**
```
~/PortfolioAnalyzer/
```

### **After Downloading:**
```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
ls -la institutional*.py

# You should see all 3 files
```

Then go back to STEP 2 or STEP 3.

---

## WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU START:

### **First Time (with integration):**
```
🔍 Checking files...
✅ All files found

⚙️  Running integration...
📝 Patch 1: Adding imports...
📝 Patch 2: Adding metal cycle analysis...
📝 Patch 3: Adding morning tape...
[... more patches ...]
✅ Integration complete!

Created: alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py

🚀 Ready to run!
```

### **Then Streamlit starts:**
```
Collecting usage statistics...
You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.

Local URL: http://localhost:8501
Network URL: http://192.168.1.X:8501
```

### **In the app, you'll see:**
1. **Morning Tape** at the very top
   - Gold & Silver predictions
   - Metal regime status
   - Today's action plan

2. **Portfolio Health Check**
   - Overall health score
   - Concentration warnings

3. **Individual stock analysis** with:
   - New badges (SMC ✓, DISCOUNT/PREMIUM, HYPE ⚠️, PP CLOSED ✓)
   - Metal-aware position sizing
   - Stricter discovery exceptions

---

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Error: "institutional_enhancements.py not found"
```bash
# Check files in directory
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
ls -la institutional*.py

# If missing, download from Claude
# Make sure you're saving to the RIGHT directory
```

### Error: "No module named 'institutional_enhancements'"
```bash
# Make sure files are in SAME directory as alpha_miner_enhanced.py
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
ls -la

# Both should be in same folder
```

### Integration script doesn't run
```bash
# Try with python3 explicitly
python3 integrate_institutional_v2.py

# Or check Python version
python3 --version
# Should be 3.8 or higher
```

### App starts but looks the same
```bash
# You might be running the OLD file
# Make sure you're running:
streamlit run alpha_miner_institutional_v2.py

# NOT:
streamlit run alpha_miner_enhanced.py
```

---

## QUICK CHECK: IS IT WORKING?

When the app starts, you should see:

1. **At the very top:** "📊 MORNING TAPE" section
2. **Gold price and predictions** (e.g., "Gold: $2,045")
3. **Silver price and predictions**
4. **Regime status** (e.g., "METALS_BULLISH")

If you see these → IT'S WORKING! ✅

If you DON'T see these → You're running the old file.

---

## THE ABSOLUTE SIMPLEST WAY:

```bash
cd ~/PortfolioAnalyzer
bash startup_check.sh
```

Then answer "y" when it asks to run.

That's it! 🚀
